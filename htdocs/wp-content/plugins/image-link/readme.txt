A plugin which looks for &lt;IMG&gt; tags in the excerpt and, if found, wraps them with a link to the post permalink.

== Description ==

A plugin which looks for &lt;IMG&gt; tags in the excerpt and, if found, wraps them with a link to the post permalink.

Helps with thumbnail images in the excerpt shown on the index page. There isn't any rocket science here - it's simply up to the post author to provide the image (and text) in the optional excerpt in WordPress' write a post form. However, the "trick" bit is to make that thumbnail image a hyper-link to the post. I've done this with this simple WordPress plug-in.

== Installation ==

* Just put the plug-in into your plug-in directory and activate it.
* That's it, any excerpts with images (using &lt;img /&gt; tags) will have the image wrapped up as a hyper-link to the post's permalink.
